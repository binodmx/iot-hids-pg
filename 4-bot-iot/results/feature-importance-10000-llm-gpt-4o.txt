Based on the provided normal and attack entries, the following features show significant differences between normal and attack entries:

1. `stddev`
2. `N_IN_Conn_P_SrcIP`
3. `min`
4. `mean`
5. `max`

These features exhibit noticeable variations between normal and attack entries, making them useful for distinguishing between the two categories.
