# LLM-driven Policy Generation for IoT Intrusion Detection Systems

## Introduction

In this research we try to find how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform to improve the IoT security and access control. In particular, we investigate whether LLMs can generate effective policies (rules) to detect intrusion attacks in IoT systems. This experiment integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling capabilities of LLMs to build a novel policy generation framework for IoT Intrusion Detection Systems.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create `.env` file in the root directory and add API keys as follows.

    ```bash
    OPENAI_API_KEY=
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=
    ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
    LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=
    LANGCHAIN_PROJECT=
    LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=
    ```

4. Create `data` directory in the root directory and sub directories for datasets as follows.

    ```
    data
    |-cic-iot
    |-wustl-iiot
    |-ton-iot
    |-bot-iot
    â””-unsw-nb15
    ```

5. Place downloaded datasets in the relevant sub directories.

6. Run Python notebooks in order for each dataset.

    > For ex:
    >
    > Run `0-analysis.ipynb`, `1-preprocess.ipynb`, `2-evaluation-2-class-ml.ipynb`, `3-evaluation-2-class-vs.ipynb`, ... in `1-cic-iot` directory to evaluate `CICIoT2023` dataset.
